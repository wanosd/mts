<center><h2>Membership</h2></center>

<p>We are a strongly community-based club and are keen to promote tennis as a means of enabling locals, both adult and children, to participate in both sporting and social activities. We also arrange regular coaching for our junior members to ensure that their skills develop, and for the more competitive there are competitions and leagues organised throughout the year. 
At the beginning of 2005 membership stood at record numbers, with families, junior, and adult participation at very high levels.</p>

<p>You can register to become a member by clicking on the <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/createmembers" class="home">Register</a> link here or at the top of the page. Once you are completed the relevant information, an email will be sent to 
our committee for approval. Once approval is made, you can make payment at any of our scheduled club events where a committee member will be present</p>
